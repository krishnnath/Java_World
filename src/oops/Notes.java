              -:OOPS:-
OOPS:- Object Oriented Programming Language System/Structure.
       The main purpose of oop is to deal with real world entity using programming language.
 
OOPS Features:- 
(i) Class, (ii) Object, (iii) Inheritance, (iv) Polymorphism,  (v) Encapsulation,  (vi) Abstraction.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Class:-
(i) Class is a collection of objects. 
(ii) Class is not a real-world entity. It is just a template and blueprint.
(iii)Class is structure and behavior of object. 
(iv) Class does not occupy spaces. It’s logical entry 
(v)  All Java codes are defined in to the class 
(Vi) Class is the user defined data type.

Example:- Dog---> (color, bread) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Object – 
  (i) Object is an instance of class. 
  (ii) Object is real world entity. 
  (iii) Object occupies memory.
  
Object consist of :-
(i) Identity Name (Name of Dog)
(ii) State / Attribute (Color, Breed, age)
(iii)Behavior (Eat, Run, Bark)  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Inheritance:-
  (i)  inheritance the properties of parent class into child class.
 (ii)  It is the reused ability.
 (iii) we can achieve inheritance by using extends keyword.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
4) Polymorphism:- The Same object having e different behavior.
Example- Boy---> i) Boy become a teacher he will teach. 
                ii) Boy become a son when he will be near a his parent.
               iii) Boy become a brother he will be near a his siblings.
                iv) Boy become a boyfriend  he will be near his girlfriend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Encapsulation :-Encapsulation bind in a single unit of Your Data and Method.
Example - Multiple Row material or chemical add on a single capsul.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Abstraction:- is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user.
only the higthligted set of service provided to the user.
