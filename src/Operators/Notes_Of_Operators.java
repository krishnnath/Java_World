                 Java Operators
  Definition- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
  
  
  Java divides the operators into the following groups:
   1.  Arithmetic operators
   2.  Relation operators
   3.  Logical operators
   4.  Bitwise operators
   5.  Assignment operators
   6.  Conditional operators
   7.  Misc operators

   1.  Arithmetic Operators
 Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
 
 Operator    	Name	          Description	                            Example	
   +	      Addition	      Adds together two values	                    x + y	
   -	      Subtraction	  Subtracts one value from another           	x - y	
   *	      Multiplication  Multiplies two values	                        x * y	
   /	      Division	      Divides one value by another	                x / y	
   %	      Modulus	      Returns the division remainder	            x % y	
  ++	      Increment	      Increases the value of a variable by 1	    ++x	
  --	      Decrement       Decreases the value of a variable by 1	    --x

  2.    Relation operators
Relational operators are used to test comparison between operands or values. It can be use to test whether two values are equal or not equal or less than or greater than etc.

Operator	Description
==	        Check if two operand are equal
!=	        Check if two operand are not equal.
>	        Check if operand on the left is greater than operand on the right
<	        Check operand on the left is smaller than right operand
>=	        Check left operand is greater than or equal to right operand
<=	        Check if operand on left is smaller than or equal to right operand

3.      Logical operators
Logical Operators are used to check conditional expression.
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.

Java supports following 3 logical operator. Suppose we have two variables whose values are: a=true and b=false.

Operator	   Description	       Example
&&	           Logical AND	       (a && b) is false
||	           Logical OR	       (a || b) is true
!	           Logical NOT	       (!a) is false
